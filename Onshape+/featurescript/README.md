# featurescript README

Welcome to the FeatureScript Syntax Highlighting README! Currently under development, hopefully in the near future we can create a stable release for Onshape's FeatureScript syntax in VSCode! 

## Features

TODO: Change 
Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

None so far, since this is our first VSCode Extension, we're learning along the way 

## Extension Settings

### TODO: Add our own settings and modify the auto-generated README text: 

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Everything is currently an issue

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Added basic extension files and README. Tune in for more!
